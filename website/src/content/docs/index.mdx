ThreatIntelRelay consolidates multiple open-source threat feeds and exposes them through a single MCP-compatible API. The service is deployed on Kubernetes and uses FastAPI for its HTTP interface.

**Work in progress:** The project is actively being developed and many of the features documented here are still experimental. The end goal is to provide Model Context Protocol endpoints so that AI agents can easily consume OSINT threat intelligence in a consistent format.
