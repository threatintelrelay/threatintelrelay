We are on a mission to make OSINT threat intelligence effortlessly accessible to AI, ThreatIntelRelay aggregates and normalizes diverse feeds into a consistent MCP API, accelerating autonomous threat detection and response.

**Work in progress:** The project is actively being developed and many of the features documented here are still experimental. The end goal is to provide Model Context Protocol endpoints so that AI agents can easily consume OSINT threat intelligence in a consistent format.
